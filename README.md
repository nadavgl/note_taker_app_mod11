## Description

I created this app for users to save their notes in a centralized place. Users can store and delete notes.

## Usage

Users can create a new notes card by inputting a title and the text of the note. Once it's inputted the application saves the note and displays it on the left column. The note can be accessed again by clicking on the saved note. If the note is no longer needed it can be deleted by clicking the red trash button.
